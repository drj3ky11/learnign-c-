Just some programing exercies to improve c++. I am following the google resources https://developers.google.com/edu/c++

book_v1.cpp https://github.com/drj3ky11/learnign-c-/blob/master/book_v1.cpp ->>>>>>> Exercice 2: Your college book store needs your help in estimating its business for next year. Experience has shown that sales depend greatly on whether a book is required for a course or just optional, and whether or not it has been used in the class before. A new, required textbook will sell to 90% of prospective enrollment, but if it has been used in the class before, only 65% will buy. Similarly, 40% of prospective enrollment will buy a new, optional textbook, but if it has been used in the class before only 20% will buy. (Note that "used" here does not mean second-hand books.)

Write a program that accepts as input a series of books (until the user enters a sentinel). For each book ask for: a code for the book, the single copy cost for the book, the current number of books on hand, the prospective class enrollment, and data that indicates if the book is required/optional, new/used in past. As output, show all the input information in a nicely formatted screen along with how many books must be ordered (if any, note that only new books are ordered), the total cost of each order. <<<<<<<<<<<
